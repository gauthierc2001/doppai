ORIGINAL TWEETS TO ANALYZE:
${allText}

DEEP ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

1. LINGUISTIC DNA:
- Word choice patterns: formal/casual/technical/slang ratio
- Sentence complexity: fragments vs full sentences vs compound thoughts
- Rhythm: short bursts, long flows, or mixed patterns
- Repeated phrases or verbal tics (exactly as written)
- Unique expressions that only this person uses
- Grammar style: perfect/casual/intentionally broken

2. EMOTIONAL SIGNATURE:
- Energy baseline: high/medium/low energy default
- Emotional range: reserved to expressive scale
- Excitement indicators: what makes them animated
- Frustration patterns: how they express disagreement
- Joy expressions: how they show happiness
- Confidence markers: humble to assertive spectrum

3. THOUGHT ARCHITECTURE:
- How they structure ideas (linear/scattered/circular)
- Question vs statement preference
- Use of examples, analogies, or metaphors
- Abstract vs concrete thinking patterns
- Problem-solving approach: analytical/intuitive/practical
- Teaching style: explain/assume/challenge audience

4. SOCIAL INTERACTION BLUEPRINT:
- Audience awareness: talking TO followers vs AT the void
- Engagement style: conversational/broadcast/educational
- Humor deployment: timing, type, frequency
- Vulnerability level: oversharing to private spectrum
- Authority tone: expert/peer/student positioning

5. CONTENT PSYCHOLOGY:
- What topics spark their passion (language intensity analysis)
- Values revealed through word choices
- Future vs present vs past temporal focus
- Individual vs collective perspective ("I" vs "we")
- Optimism/realism/pessimism in different contexts

6. TECHNICAL WRITING MARKERS:
- Punctuation personality (!!!, ???, ..., etc.)
- Capitalization strategy (emphasis patterns)
- Emoji integration style and specific favorites
- Hashtag usage philosophy
- Link sharing approach

7. CREATIVE POTENTIAL MAPPING:
- Topics they haven't covered but would likely discuss
- How they'd approach unfamiliar subjects
- Their knowledge transfer patterns
- Logical extensions of their interests
- Personality consistency across different moods

REPLICATION RULEBOOK:
Create 20+ SPECIFIC behavioral rules for perfect mimicry:
- Vocabulary rules ("always says X instead of Y")
- Punctuation rules ("never ends with periods")
- Emotional rules ("uses üî• when excited about tech")
- Structure rules ("starts controversial takes with 'unpopular opinion:'")
- Creativity rules ("makes analogies to [their field]")

CRITICAL: This person should be replicable across ANY topic while maintaining 100% authenticity to their voice. Focus on patterns that reveal HOW they think, not just WHAT they think about.`
